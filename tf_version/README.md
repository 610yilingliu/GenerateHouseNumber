# DCGAN in Tensorflow

## Source

[Yuliya's code](https://github.com/YuliyaLab/AIclass/blob/master/L9_DCGAN_housenum_1.ipynb)

## Instruction

For most of comment with single `#`, it comes from Yuliya's code.

For most of comment with double `#` and comment surrounded by `"""`, it is my own opinion. Read the comment carefully if you know very few about Tensorflow and Python.

My English may not be good enough, feel free to ask what some function means on unit discussion board, by raising issue or even send a email to 22214014@student.uwa.edu.au if you think anything is misleading.

For files introduced by the following Structure part, feel free to delete files that I say "generated by code", after running the code your result will be stored in dir `logs` and dir `report_imgs` in your current directory by default

## Structure

### Dir `data`

Please put **train_32x32.mat** in this directory, it is too large for me to upload in github. You can also change variable `FILE_PATH` and `MAT_NAME` in `__main__.py` otherwise it will be error

If you haven't download that file, you can find it in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8TvBIAjueTDmxSOFMSPjlQRSgtabO2a/view?usp=sharing)

### Dir `result`

My own training results, feel free to delete it

### Dir `training_checkpoints`

Tensorflow checkpoints generated by code.

### `__init__.py`

Python package label, you cannot remove it even it is empty

### `__main__.py`

Runner

### `dcgan.py`

Functions for model building and evaluation

### `get_npz.py`

Convert images and .mat file to .npz file

### `preprocess.py`

Helper file, contains importing(from npz file), scaling , regularizing numpy array.

### `visualize_tools.py`

Totally self- written toolkit for visualization and export results

# How to run

Simply type `python -m tf_version` in its parent folder (If you haven't change anything its parent folder will be GenerateHouseNumber) to run this package

If you have trouble in importing module `tf_version` while using VSCode to open this folder as a project and run `__main__.py`

please change the following code 
```
from tf_version.get_npz import *
from tf_version.dcgan import *
from tf_version.preprocess import *
from tf_version.visualize_tools import *
```

into
```
from get_npz import *
from dcgan import *
from preprocess import *
from visualize_tools import *
```
